tw2.jqplugins.chosen
====================

Chosen is a JavaScript plugin that makes long,
unwieldy select boxes much more user-friendly.

For more information about Chosen, see the harvest website:
http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/ or the Github repository
for chosen: https://github.com/harvesthq/chosen

Note! In order to get around scrolling z-index problems 
found when displaying a 'chosen' within a jq ui dialog box,
this fork uses modded .css and .js files which can be found
at: https://github.com/gil/chosen

Chosen is licensed under the MIT license and so is this
ToscaWidgets2 library.

The bundled version of Chosen in this project is v0.9.8
